				<a href="http://www.carbonmap.org"><img class="projectimage" src="carbonmap.png" alt="Carbon Map Thumbnail"></a>
				<p>We launched in March 2012 with <a href="http://www.carbonmap.org">CarbonMap.org</a>, a website using a newly developed animated cartogram tool to explore responsibility for climate change. It was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/mar/29/carbon-map-infographic-world">featured prominently by the Guardian</a> but was created as a submission for the World Bank&rsquo;s <a href="wwwr.worldbank.org/appsforclimate">Apps for Climate</a> competition.</p>

				<p><a href="betterorworse/">An interactive animation</a> to mark the Rio+20 conference. The interactive summarises 20 years of global economic and environmental data to ask whether the world is getting better or worse. Users can give their view and see which genders, age groups and continents are most positive or negative. It was created for the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/interactive/2012/jun/19/rio20-interactive-world-better-worse">Global Development Desk.</a></p>

				<p><a href="https://www.joininuk.org/wheretheystarted">A fun interactive map</a> created for <a href="https://www.joininuk.org">Join In</a> to show which counties have produced which Olympians. The map uses an animated cartogram to show trends both expected (boxers tend to come from big cities, and sailors from the coast) and unexpected (South Wales's gymnastic eminence or the North West's skill at swimming).</p>

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<h3><span class="yellowdot">&bull;</span> Why &lsquo;Kiln&rsquo;?</h3>
				<p>Information is a bit like clay: it exists in abundance but only becomes interesting when it finds the right form. A kiln is a furnace where that form – a combination of materials, craft and design – is turned into something useful or beautiful.
				<h3><span class="yellowdot">&bull;</span> So Kiln doesn&rsquo;t stand for anything?</h3>
				<p>Not really. We could say &lsquo;Knowledge, Ideas, Learning, News&rsquo;, but that would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym">backronym</a>.</p>
				<h3><span class="yellowdot">&bull;</span> Are you Italian?</h3>
				<p>No. We chose the .it domain because kiln is also a verb (&lsquo;to kiln it&rsquo;) and also because it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone">homophone</a> for &lsquo;killin&rsquo; it&rsquo; (which, among other things, can mean &lsquo;to be doing something very good&rsquo;).</p>
