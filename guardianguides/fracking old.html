				<dt>The issue</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">The issue at a glance</div>Shale gas is natural gas stored in fine-grained sedimentary rocks. It can be extracted using a process known as hydraulic fracturing &ndash; &quot;fracking&quot; &ndash; which involved pumping pressurised water, sand and chemicals into the ground. Advocates argue that exploiting the world&rsquo;s huge shale gas deposits will help limit energy prices and reduce consumption of dirtier coal and oil. But sceptics argue that fracking is dangerous and that extra gas supplies will boost rather than reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.</dd>
				<dt>Current situation</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">Why is it being talked about now?</div>As shale gas production has increased, so has the controversy surrounding fracking. In the US, where the technology was developed, fracking now accounts for around a quarter of total gas production but critics say it will </span><span class="c7"><a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/05/fracking-new-york-poison-claim">poison New York&rsquo;s water supply</a></span><span>, while the first fracking experiments in the UK were </span><span class="c7"><a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes">linked to earthquakes</a></span><span>. </span><span class="c7"><a class="c3" href="http://www.channel4.com/news/france-votes-to-ban-shale-gas-drilling">France</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7"><a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/14/bulgaria-bans-shale-gas-exploration">Bulgaria</a></span><span>&nbsp;have already banned fracking and campaigners in many countries and US states are calling for the same.</dd>
				<dt>History</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">A brief history</div>Shale gas was formed hundreds of millions of years ago from decomposing plants trapped by clay and silt. Small amounts of shallow shale gas was extracted <a class="c3" href="http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/brochures/Shale_Gas_March_2011.pdf">in the 19th century</a>&nbsp;but it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1970s that fracking technology started to develop in earnest, supported by US government R&amp;D funding. After a slow start, American shale gas production started&nbsp;soaring in around 2005, leading to growing interest in the energy source around the world. By 2011, fracking experiments were underway in <a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/17/uk-shale-gas-warning">UK</a>, <a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/21/china-shale-gas-well">China</a>, <a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/01/gas-fracking-extraction-europe">Poland</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere, and the global shale gas endowment had been estimated at more than <a class="c3" href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/">169 trillion cubic metres</a>&nbsp;&ndash; around the same as proved reserves of conventional natural gas.
				</dd>
				<dt>Technology</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">How does fracking work?</div>A hole is drilled down into shale rocks as much as 3000m below the surface and then extended horizontally through the shale layer. Large quantities of water, sand and chemicals are then pumped down into the horizontal well at high pressure. This opens up tiny fissures in the shale, which are held open by the sand, enabling the trapped gas to escape. It bubbles out of the rock, aided by the injected chemicals, and piped off at surface level.</dd>
				<dt>Controversy</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">Why is it controversial?</div>Many shale deposits lie underneath aquifers and if the cement casing around the wellhole is not adequate, then the process of drilling and fracking can release chemicals into the aquifer &ndash; a link <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/09/epa-reports-fracking-groundwater-pollution">acknowledged by the US Environmental Protection Agency</a> in relation to a community in Wyoming that has had to stop using local drinking water. Other possible problems include</span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes">&nbsp;</a><a class="c3" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes">earthquakes</a>; potentially explosive methane leaks; the disposal of the water-chemical-rock sludge that returns to the surface; and massive water demands, which may deplete local ecosystems.</dd>
				<dt>Climate change</dt>
				<dd><div class="ddh1">Is shale gas good or bad for climate change?</div>All fossil fuels release planet-warming CO2 when burned. However, creating a unit of heat or electricity from natural gas produces less CO2 than creating the same amount of energy from coal or oil. Hence some commentators argue that shale gas is good news for the climate, as it could be used to substitute more polluting coal in the coming decades while renewable and nuclear sources are scaling up. But most environmentalists disagree, arguing that to avoid dangerous climate change we need to switch away from all fossil fuels as rapidly as possible, and that new gas sources will just lead to more CO2.</dd>
