<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Guardian Guide to Shale Gas and Fracking</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>1. The issue at a glance</b></p>
<p class="p1">Shale gas is natural gas stored deep underground in fine-grained sedimentary rocks. It can be extracted using a process known as hydraulic fracturing – "fracking" – which involves pumping huge quantities of pressurised water, sand and chemicals into the rocks. Advocates argue that exploiting the world’s vast shale gas deposits will help keep energy affordable and cut consumption of dirtier coal. But sceptics claim that fracking is dangerous and polluting, and that tapping into extra natural gas supplies will boost rather than reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>2. Why is it being talked about now?</b></p>
<p class="p1">Shale gas production and controversy are both increasing fast. In the US, where the technology was developed, shale gas production has grown rapidly to account for around a quarter of the country’s natural gas production but critics say it could <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/05/fracking-new-york-poison-claim"><span class="s1">poison New York’s drinking water supply</span></a>. Meanwhile, the first fracking project in the UK claimed to find trillions of cubic meters of gas but was put on hold after being <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes"><span class="s1">linked to minor earthquakes</span></a>. Due to these kinds of concerns, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/france-votes-to-ban-shale-gas-drilling"><span class="s1">France</span></a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/14/bulgaria-bans-shale-gas-exploration"><span class="s1">Bulgaria</span></a> have banned fracking and campaigners are calling for other countries and US states to follow suit. But <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/shale-gas-fracking-drills-get-the-go-ahead-in-western-australia/story-e6frg9ex-1226288723917"><span class="s2">Australia has recently given fracking the go-ahead to,</span></a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9117072/China-claims-worlds-biggest-shale-gas-reserves.html"><span class="s2">China is making plans to do so</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>3. A brief history</b></p>
<p class="p1">Shale gas was formed hundreds of millions of years ago from decomposing plants trapped by clay and silt. A small amount of gas was extracted from shallow shale layers <a href="http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/brochures/Shale_Gas_March_2011.pdf"><span class="s1">in the 19th century</span></a>, but it wasn’t until the 1970s that fracking technology started to develop in earnest, supported by US government R&amp;D funding. After a slow start, American shale gas production started soaring in around 2005, leading to growing interest in the energy source around the world. By 2011, fracking experiments were underway in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/17/uk-shale-gas-warning"><span class="s1">UK</span></a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/21/china-shale-gas-well"><span class="s1">China</span></a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/01/gas-fracking-extraction-europe"><span class="s1">Poland</span></a> and elsewhere, and estimates of global shale-gas reserves were rising fast, with the outgoing head of Shell <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/apr/08/shell-oil-gas-james-smith"><span class="s2">claiming</span></a> that there could be enough to power the world for 200 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>4. How does fracking work?</b></p>
<p class="p1">A hole is drilled down into shale rocks more than a kilometre below the surface and then extended horizontally through the shale layer. The wellhole is lined and then massive quantities of water, sand and chemicals are pumped down into the horizontal well at high pressure. This opens up tiny fissures in the shale, which are held open by the sand, enabling the trapped gas to escape. It bubbles out of the rock, aided by the injected chemicals, and is piped off at surface level. See <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/25/1330199990222/Fracking-graphic-2-001.jpg"><span class="s2">a large graphic of a fracking site</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>5. Why is it controversial?</b></p>
<p class="p1">Fracking has been linked to a wide range of problems, the highest profile of which has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/09/epa-reports-fracking-groundwater-pollution"><span class="s2">chemical contamination of underground aquifers</span></a>. This connection has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/09/epa-reports-fracking-groundwater-pollution"><span class="s1">acknowledged by the US Environmental Protection Agency</span></a> in the case of a community in Wyoming that has had to stop drinking local water, though a recent <a href="http://energy.utexas.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151:shale-gas-regulation&amp;catid=1:features&amp;Itemid=146"><span class="s2">University of Texas report</span></a> said contamination was more likely to be caused by surface spills and therefore could be avoided. Either way, details of the chemicals used in fracking are <a href="http://fracfocus.org/"><span class="s2">only just starting to be disclosed</span></a>, and their health impacts are not well understood. Other fracking risks include ecologically damaging levels of water consumption; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes"><span class="s2">minor earthquakes</span></a>; emissions of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/air-sampling-reveals-high-emissions-from-gas-field-1.9982"><span class="s2">explosive and climate-warming methane</span></a>; and the impact of clearing forests for fracking sites.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>6. Is shale gas good news or bad new for climate change?</b></p>
<p class="p1">Creating heat or electricity by burning natural gas produces less CO2 (and other pollutants) than creating the same amount of energy from coal or oil. For that reason the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/20/fossil-fuel-lobbying-shale-gas"><span class="s2">gas industry and some commentators argue</span></a> that shale gas is good news for the climate, as it could be used as a greener substitute for coal in the coming decades, holding down carbon emissions while renewables and nuclear are scaling up. But the limited evidence that exists suggests that shale gas may be no better than coal, due to the <a href="http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/news/attachments/Howarth-EtAl-2011.pdf"><span class="s2">large emissions of methane</span></a> from fracking sites. Furthermore, as <a href="http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/coop_shale_gas_report_update_v3.10.pdf"><span class="s2">a recent Tyndall Centre report</span></a> concluded, without a global CO2 cap, additional gas resources won’t necessarily reduce coal use and may instead cause overall fossil fuel use and carbon emissions to increase.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>7. Where are the shale gas reserves?</b></p>
<p class="p1">The US government <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/"><span class="s2">assessed 32 countries</span></a> and concluded they had of <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/"><span class="s1">169 trillion cubic metres</span></a> of technically recoverable shale gas (around the same as the global economically recoverable reserves of conventional natural gas), with the largest reserves in China, the US, Argentina and Mexico (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2011/apr/26/shale-gas-hydraulic-fracking-graphic"><span class="s2">see map</span></a>). But the figures keep changing. Estimated US reserves doubled between 2010 and 2011, and the company drilling in Britain – <a href="http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/"><span class="s3">Cuadrilla Resources</span></a> – <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/sep/23/cuadrilla-shale-gas-uk-energy"><span class="s2">claims its site near Blackpool in Lancashire contains more than 5 trillion cubic meters</span></a>, ten times more than the American government estimate for the whole of the UK. Similarly, China’s own survey <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9117072/China-claims-worlds-biggest-shale-gas-reserves.html"><span class="s2">recently put its reserves at 25 trillion cubic meters</span></a>, nearly double the figure given in the US survey. But sceptics claim these figures may be overblown and that many reserves will prove be too expensive or difficult to extract.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>8. How significant is shale gas?</b></p>
<p class="p1">Shale gas could be hugely significant in the some regions, including the US. By 2035 the country expects <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/"><span class="s2">fracking to account for 46% of its gas production</span></a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2011/apr/26/shale-gas-hydraulic-fracking-graphic"><span class="s2">according to BP</span></a> shale gas, tar sands and other ‘unconventional’ fossil fuel sources will make North and South America largely self-sufficient in energy by 2030. By contrast, a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/03/shale-gas-game-changer-fracking"><span class="s2">Deutsche Bank report</span></a> looking at the potential for shale in Europe concluded that, due partly to higher population density and stronger environmental regulation, “those waiting for a shale gas 'revolution' outside the US will likely be disappointed, in terms of both price and the speed at which high-volume production can be achieved.” Much will depend how the debate about environmental impacts and regulation plays out in coming years. Fossil fuel prices will be another factor, as higher prices will make fracking more economical.</p>
