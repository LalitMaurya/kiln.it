Script for graphic birth stories

Anne and Sally's stories are based on the real-life experiences of women who have contacted Birthrights. They show us the power of choice and respectful care for women during pregnancy and childbirth. In September 2013, Birthrights asked over 1000 women who had given birth in the last two years about their experiences. I'll highlight some of the results as we look at the stories.

Many women in the UK are not given a choice about how or where they give birth. 26% of the women who responded to our survey were not given a choice about where they had their baby.

Women must be able to make choices about how they give birth, including about pain relief and position in labour. Hospitals should usually be able to accommodate their choices without risking the woman or baby's safety. 

[Anne: slider 3, panel 2]

We found that 15% of women were unhappy with the availability of pain relief. 20% were unhappy with the choice of position offered to them in labour.

Women's consent should always be sought for medical procedures. 12% of women who responded to our survey told us they had not been asked before procedures took place.

24% of women who had instrumental births, that means a doctor used forceps or a ventouse, said their consent had not been sought.

A labour ward should never be so busy that staff do not introduce themselves. Our survey showed that 20% of women did not know the names of staff caring for them.

Communicating kindly is a fundamental part of respectful care. Sadly this basic principle can sometimes be forgotten by medical staff. 8% of women who gave birth in hospital said they were not spoken to kindly. That was higher in London, where 13% of women said staff did not speak kindly to them.

The quality of post-natal care in the UK is very variable. Many women have distressing experiences of care after their babies are born. A woman's partner should be able to remain with her after her baby's birth if she wants support.

How women are treated during childbirth can have a impact on their self-image and their relationships with their baby and their partner. Half of women told us their experience had an impact on their relationship with their baby. A quarter of those women who gave birth in hospital said said the impact was negative. Only 4% of women who gave birth in birth centres felt it had a negative impact.
